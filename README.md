# Conclusion

Based on the analysis, the following insights were gathered:

- Overall Churn Rate: The churn rate is 27%, which suggests a significant area for improvement in retaining customers.

- Reasons for Churn: The primary reasons for churn are related to competition and customer experience issues. Customers who reported higher numbers of support calls were 
  more likely to churn, highlighting customer experience as a key factor.

- Retention Insights: Customers with longer contracts and those in group accounts tend to have better retention rates. This suggests that users who commit to longer periods    or join as part of a group are less likely to leave.
